    The primary goal of this code is to facilitate CAN bus mirroring via a serial communication interface. This functionality is essential for several reasons, particularly in scenarios where data communication between CAN-enabled devices and other systems (such as a Raspberry Pi) is necessary.

CAN bus mirroring serves the purpose of replicating CAN bus data onto a different communication medium, in this case, a serial connection. This can be beneficial for various reasons:

Integration with Different Systems: Serial communication is a widely supported interface across a multitude of devices and platforms. By mirroring CAN bus data to a serial interface, the CAN-enabled device, like an Arduino with a CAN bus shield, can easily communicate with systems like Raspberry Pi, which may not have direct CAN bus support.

Compatibility and Interoperability: Many embedded systems and microcontrollers support serial communication protocols. Mirroring CAN data to serial allows for seamless integration and data exchange between diverse devices, facilitating interoperability.

Data Processing and Analysis: Serial data is relatively easy to handle and process on standard computing platforms like Raspberry Pi. By mirroring CAN data over serial, the receiving end (e.g., Raspberry Pi) can easily process, analyze, and utilize the CAN bus data for various applications, such as logging, real-time monitoring, or control.

Prototyping and Development: During the development and prototyping phase, using serial communication for CAN bus mirroring allows for efficient testing and debugging. Developers can easily monitor and analyze the CAN data on a more accessible interface before implementing the final CAN bus functionality.

Flexibility in Communication: Serial communication can be extended over longer distances compared to CAN bus communication. By mirroring CAN data to serial, it's possible to transmit CAN bus data over longer distances using appropriate serial communication protocols and hardware, providing flexibility in communication options.

In summary, implementing CAN bus mirroring via serial communication broadens the scope of communication for CAN-enabled devices, enhances compatibility, and facilitates easier integration with various systems. It allows for effective data processing and analysis, especially on platforms that support serial communication, contributing to more flexible and efficient communication solutions.
